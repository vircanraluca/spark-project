ðŸ”§ Project Description â€“ Spark Data Engineering
This project is a practical implementation of a data engineering pipeline using Apache Spark, focused on processing and analyzing structured data from real-world business scenarios such as sales tracking, product performance, and customer behavior.

The pipeline performs the following key tasks:

Data ingestion from various sources, primarily CSV and JSON files (e.g., sales data, customer info, product catalogs).

Data cleaning and validation, including filtering incorrect values and handling missing or inconsistent records.

Data transformation and joins, such as merging sales data with product and customer details to enrich the dataset.

Aggregations and business analytics, like:

Monthly sales per category

Top-selling products

Store performance metrics

Average prices and order durations

Advanced SQL queries for identifying trends and computing KPIs.

Data quality checks (e.g., missing values, outlier detection)

Currency conversion example, demonstrating applied business logic
